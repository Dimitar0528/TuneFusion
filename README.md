## 3. Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (>= 20.x) (https://nodejs.org/en)
- npm (>= 10.x) (comes with Node.js by default)
- MySQL Installer (>= 8.x) (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
- After you have downloaded the MySQL Installer, you need to open it and also install MySQL Server (>= 8.x) and MySQL Workbench (>= 8.x) (reference video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2rilf_v4V4).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dimitar0528/TuneFusion.git
   cd TuneFusion
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

   2.1. Create a .env file inside the server folder with the following content:

   ```bash
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   DB_HOST=your_database_host
   DB_PORT=your_database_port
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_for_jwt
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
   ```

   - where the DB\_{VARIABLES} are your MySQL database variables, the JWT_SECRET_KEY is the secret key for signing / verifying the JSON Web Token (JWT) and the SENDGRID_API_KEY is the Sendgrid API Key needed for the 2FA to work. ( How to set up an Sengrid API Key: https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys)

3. **Frontend Setup**:

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start MySQL**:

   Ensure MySQL is running on your local machine or update the connection string in the backend configuration to point to your MySQL instance.

2. **Run Backend**:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run server
   ```

3. **Run Frontend**:

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173/`.

## 4. Useful Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from an already opened terminal:

| Command           | Action                                      |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev client at `localhost:5173` |
| `npm run server`  | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build`   | Build the production site to `/dist/`       |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the build locally, before deploying |
| `npm run lint`    | Run ESLint to check for code quality        |

  - bcryptjs
  - and more

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React.js
