   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-name/TuneFusion.git
   cd TuneFusion
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
    2.1. Create a .env file inside the server folder with the following content:

   ```bash
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   DB_HOST=your_database_host
   DB_PORT=your_database_port
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_for_jwt
   ```
   where the DB_{VARIABLES} are your MySQL database variables and the JWT_SECRET_KEY is    the secret key for signing / verifying the JSON Web Token (JWT).
